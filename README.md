Anima Beyond Fantasy Alter System for Foundry VTT, Thank you Anima Project Studio for allowing me to do this.

I’m a solo developer working on this Anima Beyond Fantasy character sheet for Foundry VTT. As such, updates and bug fixes may take some time, and I appreciate your patience and understanding.
As a long-time Game Master for Anima, I initially ran games through Roll20. However, after discovering Foundry VTT, at a time when no Anima system was available, so I began developing my own version. Since then, a talented group of creators has released a separate Anima system, but by that point, my project was already well underway. And I'd say there are a decent amount of differences between the systems, so give them both a try.

The system follows the Anima Beyond Fantasy rules, with several enhancements and customizations based on my house rules used at my table (since that's the whole reason I started). That said, I am actively working to incorporate global configuration options that will allow users to align the system more closely with the official core rules, should they prefer.

Many mechanics in the sheet are automated, including calculations based on official charts and tables from the books. My goal is to streamline gameplay and reduce the burden of manual calculations, allowing players to focus more on the story and action at the table. There is also a comprehensive item compendium included, which streamlines character creation by allowing items to be easily dragged and dropped directly into the actor sheet.

Elis (@Elisianthus) has contributed greatly to the system. She has created most of the compendium items from the ground up, gave me plenty of ideas for the system itself, and now is also dabbling in some code and macros to further facilitate gameplay.

I plan to continue expanding the system with a variety of quality-of-life features, both within the character sheets and the system as a whole. If there’s anything you’d like to see added or improved, feel free to open a ticket on the GitHub repository. I’m always open to feedback and suggestions.

While the system does support spanish, french, and russian to an extent they are fairly outdated.

Should the Core Exxet 2.0 rulebook ever be officially released, I also intend to develop a dedicated system to support it.

# Road Map
- full implementation of a weight system for the Armory tab, & whatever small details/ui overhauls the Armory tab is lacking.
- A QoL update for the Psychic Tab & UI changes on the Creature Tab.
- A QoL update on The Ki Tab, Better Ki Technique Managment with accumulated Ki and Ki expenditure. ~~Including the ability to create custom ki Abilities~~.
- A QoL updateo on the Magic Tab, showing much needed love for invocation & incarnation items, custom metamagic items, and more.
- Potentially a header update for a more stylized view of hp, fatigue, zeon, & pp while moving the details elsewhere.
- Auto-combat Macro Calculator.
