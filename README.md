Anima Beyond Fantasy Alter System for Foundry VTT, Thank you Anima Project Studio for allowing me to do this.

I bring you a mix of styles for an Anima Beyond Fantasy character sheet. I am a single developer working on this, so please be patient with the update and bugfixes.
As a long-time DM for Anima, I used to play on Roll20. However, when I found out about Foundry at the time, there was no Anima system available. Over time, a group of very talented people started working on an Anima system, but by that time, I was already working on my own project.
They were kind enough to let me use their auto combat calculator as reference, Thank you Linkaynn and the other members who are developing the other Anima Beyond Fanatasy page for allowing me to use your idea for the combat calculator.

I've been working on this page for a few years now, but I never posted it because I felt like it was not ready, but now here it is.
The system follows the Anima Beyond Fantasy, although some features are more tailored for my table, for example; the fumbling system (I kept the -15 per for any fumbles below the fumble level).
Worry not, as most core mechanics remain unchanged.
In this character sheet, I have made a lot of automatic calculation following the books graphs, allowing the players to focus more on playing the game than counting numbers.

I plan to incorporate plenty more of QoL mechanisms into the character pages and the system itself.
If there is anything you want to see added, please let me know.
If I ever get my hands on the Core 2.0, I will also work on a system for that.

The system has about 70% localization, if there is enough demand, I will go through and localize what I missed or skipped so that it can be played in other languages as well.

# Planned Updates
- Combat calculator is still in development.
- Active effects.
- Certain items don't have a chat card.
