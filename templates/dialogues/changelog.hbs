            <span>
                Hello all! hope all is going well. I missed last month 1 year anniversary of the system, but I have been working on it. This update brings ranged weapons and ammo into the system. As a 
                little bonus, I added a class compendium with the official classes and my rebalances and I also added a dp calculator for your current class. It does NOT support multi-classing yet, but it
                is something I am considering for the future. Other than than theres a bunch of small bug fixes, localization fixes, and visual fixes.
                The current goal is still to finish the weapon item completely with shields, defensives and more flavor texts on the chat messages, but on the side I will overhaul the inventory item and potentially the armor
                which will also include weight and price. Other than that, if you find any mistakes in the compendiums or bugs, please keep me updated as always.
                When I have more time I will continue to update my little tutorial compendium.
                Enjoy!

                Happy holidays everyone! I hope you all are doing well. I mostly got stuck debating which features to implement for the weapon attack system and how much automation I wanted.
                I always felt like it either wasnt enough or was too much, so I'm releasing what I have so far and update it as I go.
                I plan to start adding compendiums soon with the updated items as I go.
                The other changes are mostly code related, so that won't affect you.

            <span>
                Hello all, I'm releasing part 1 of the weapon update. As I work thorugh making the weapon/attack system to my liking, I keep hitting barriers
                which take time for me to understand and implement. Therefore, I'm going to release it in parts. Currently, only visiual changes and more data entry options 
                for weapons. Part 2 will include custom rolling and such, it will also include weight options.

                Hello everyone! It's been a while since the last update. I've implemented this changelog so that everyone
                can easily see the changes I push onto the system (especially for people not following the github). Anyways,
                this update is mostly fixing naming conventions and stuff, so not much for the user but more of cleaning up the code.
                The next update will include a rework for the armor/helmet items & calulations, weapon item, and inventory item. I will also 
                add an optional weight system to easily track weight n stuff. If I have the item, I want to implement a simple manual combat calculator as well
                since the auto combat calculator I want to make won't be here for a long while.
